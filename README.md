# SeatingChart
Reserves specific seats and intelligent groupings for users on their given grid layout!

Program will begin by asking for the number of rows and columns in the seating grid. Then, users can reserve a grouping of seats by entering a number 
or a specific seat using the format "R#C#". Duplicate seats cannot be reserved, and the groupings will be intelligently decided by optimizing the average distance of
each seat's distance from the center front.
